# kyiv-apartments
Hello everybody! My name is Dmytro Beretsen. I want to show my small pet project. A simple site where you can choose and buy an apartment. There are 9 cards with residential blocks where people can choose an apartment. If the user clicks on the "show more" button, +3 more cards will be displayed. It is possible to set the parameters in the form: proximity to the subway, the term of delivery of the residential quarter, additional options. Each residential block has a photo gallery where you can view photos of the residential block. The website is responsive, with a mobile and desktop version.
